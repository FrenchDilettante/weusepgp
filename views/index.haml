          %span Why use it ?

        %ol.reasons
          %li
            %h2 Private
            %p Simply because privacy matters. Internet is a wonderful tool to communicate, it's also very easy to get spied on by curious friends, neighbours or governements.
          %li
            %h2 Simple
            %p Don't change your habits, your emails or your contacts. The only difference is that if you and someone else use PGP, your conversation will stay private.

          %li
            %h2 Free
            %p PGP is free as in free beer and free speech. You don't have to pay anything and the protocol specifications are open and tested by a worldwide community.
